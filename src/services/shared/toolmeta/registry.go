		ShortDesc: "run a shell command in the sandbox, either buffered or as an explicit interactive process",
		LLMDescription: "run a shell command in the sandbox. Default mode is buffered, which executes one command to completion with stdin closed. " +
			"Use follow for long-running output-only processes, stdin for non-PTY processes that need later input, and pty only for real terminal-style interaction. " +
			"The backend returns a process_ref only for follow/stdin/pty modes. Continue those processes with continue_process, terminate them with terminate_process, and resize only pty processes with resize_process. " +
			"When you only need to change directories, prefer the cwd parameter instead of prefixing the command with cd &&. " +
			"Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\"). " +
			"Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of cd. You may use cd if the user explicitly requests it. " +
			"You may specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 1800000ms / 30 minutes). By default, the command will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes). " +
			"When issuing multiple commands:\n" +
			"  - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple exec_command tool calls in a single message.\n" +
			"  - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single exec_command call with '&&' to chain them together.\n" +
			"  - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail.\n" +
			"  - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings).\n" +
			"IMPORTANT: Avoid using this tool for file operations or code search. Use the appropriate dedicated tool:\n" +
			"  - Read files: Use read (NOT cat, head, tail, less, more)\n" +
			"  - Edit files: Use edit (NOT sed, awk)\n" +
			"  - Write files: Use write_file (NOT echo >, cat <<EOF, tee, or shell redirects)\n" +
			"  - Search files: Use glob (NOT find, fd, ls)\n" +
			"  - Search content: Use grep (NOT grep, rg, ag)\n" +
			"  - Fetch URLs: Use web_fetch (NOT curl, wget)\n" +
			"Do NOT redirect command output to temporary files (e.g., \"git diff > /tmp/out.txt\") to work around output length limits. If a tool result is large, the system persists it automatically and provides a filepath — use grep to search it or read with offset/limit to page through it. Do NOT read the entire persisted file.\n" +
			"Do NOT use shell redirection (>, >>, | tee) to write files — use write_file or edit. " +
			"Avoid unnecessary sleep commands:\n" +
			"  - Do not sleep between commands that can run immediately — just run them.\n" +
			"  - Do not retry failing commands in a sleep loop — diagnose the root cause.\n" +
			"  - If a command is long-running and you would like to be notified when it finishes — use run_in_background. No sleep needed.\n" +
			"Avoid interactive flags in buffered mode: do not pass -i, --interactive, or similar interactive flags to commands in buffered mode — they will cause the command to hang. Use pty mode for interactive commands.\n" +
			"Shell injection: when constructing commands that include variable data or user-provided strings, always quote them properly. Never pass unvalidated user input directly to shell commands. Use single quotes for literal strings, double quotes for strings containing variables.\n" +
			"Error handling: when a command fails, read the error output first. Do not blindly retry the same command — diagnose the root cause, fix the issue, then retry. If a command fails after reasonable attempts, report the failure rather than continuing to retry.\n" +
			"For git commands:\n" +
			"  - Prefer to create a new commit rather than amending an existing commit.\n" +
			"  - Before running destructive operations (e.g., git reset --hard, git push --force, git checkout --), consider whether there is a safer alternative that achieves the same goal.\n" +
			"  - Never skip hooks (--no-verify) or bypass signing (--no-gpg-sign) unless the user has explicitly asked for it. If a hook fails, investigate and fix the underlying issue.\n" +
			"  - CRITICAL: Always create NEW commits rather than amending, unless the user explicitly requests a git amend. When a pre-commit hook fails, the commit did NOT happen — so --amend would modify the PREVIOUS commit, which may destroy work.\n" +
			"  - When staging files, prefer adding specific files by name rather than using \"git add -A\" or \"git add .\", which can accidentally include sensitive files or large binaries.\n" +
			"  - NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to.\n" +
